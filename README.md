Gantry Framework Particles
================

This is my collection of particles for the Gantry5 Framework
If you have your own Particles you can push me your files - if you need space for js/css/less or anything else use the nucleus/media directory.

(You find an example how to include them in the chartJS Atom.)

## Requirements

You need to install Gantry5 for your CMS


## Installing Particles

You have to pick what you need and copy it to your Gantry5 installation - I keep the directory structure like Gantry5.


## Future of this Repo
I'm thinking about an installer for particles but have to wait how the RocketTheme Team will handle this :)
